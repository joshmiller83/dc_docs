<h1>Add-to-Cart Buttons for Drupal Commerce</h1>
<h2>What is the Add-to-Cart button?</h2>
<div class="screenshot">

    you configure the Add-to-Cart button in Drupal Commerce?" />
</div>
<p>Almost everything in Drupal Commerce is put together using a common Drupal
pattern: Content (entity and fields system), Views (listing things), and Rules
(taking actions on events). The Add-to-Cart button is no different. But there
is a bit of <em>mythical Drupal magic</em> that makes this button show up and
we aim to help you peer behind the curtains.</p>
<h2>Add-to-Cart Configuration using Fields</h2>
<p>With Drupal Commerce 1.2, we've replaced the Add-to-Cart magic with
dependable configuration settings. By altering forms in the Field UI, we now
embed options to help you create complex Add to Cart forms. Below are three
documented ways to access, alter, or create Add-to-Cart buttons.</p>
<ol class="inpagenav">
    <li><a href="#product-reference-field">Product Reference Field</a> - An
    Add-to-Cart button that is configured on the Display Node.</li>
    <li><a href="#product-type-field">Product Type Field</a> - An Add-to-Cart
    button that is configured on the Product Entity level.</li>
    <li><a href="#line-item-field">Line Item Field</a> - An Add-to-Cart
    button that is configured on the Line Item level.</li>
</ol>

    <div class="caption">

        <p>When you add a <a href="../products/Prod-Disp-Node.html">product
        reference field to an entity</a>, you have the option of injecting
        fields from the referenced products into the display of the referencing
        entity.</p>
    </div>
    <ul class="screenshot_breadcrumbs">
        <li class="first">Administration</li>
        <li>Structure</li>
        <li>Content Types</li>
        <li>Manage Product Display</li>
        <li>Fields</li>
        <li class="last">field_product</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>Any field attached to a product may be rendered into the display of an entity
(i.e. node). This feature must be enabled in the product reference field's
settings form. We call this <em>field injection</em>, because the field is
attached to the product itself but can be displayed in the referencing entities
to make this extra product data visible to customers.</p>

<div class="screenshot screenshot-caption">
    <div class="img">
        <a href="../screenshots/Add-to-Cart-Drupal-Commerce-Product-Display-Formatter.png">
        <img src="../screenshots/Add-to-Cart-Drupal-Commerce-Product-Display-Formatter.png"
             alt="Product Reference Field Configuration Screen" /></a>
    </div>
    <div class="caption">
        <p class="caption-title">Product Display Formatter</p>
        <p>Because these are fields attached to the product itself, you must
        update the field display settings on the product type to change the
        display formatter and/or the field's global visibility. </p>
    </div>
    <ul class="screenshot_breadcrumbs">
        <li class="first">Administration</li>
        <li>Store</li>
        <li>Products</li>
        <li>Product Types</li>
        <li class="last">Manage Display</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>Then in the field display settings for
each entity type that contains a product reference field, you will see all
available product reference fields to reorder them relative to other fields on
the entity or hide them.</p>
<p>A great example of a product reference field is the one found in the Product
display node type that Commerce Kickstart creates. The product reference field
enables prices, images, and other fields attached to your products to be
displayed in the node along with an Add-to-Cart button.</p>

    <div class="img">

<p>The most obvious example is the basic price field attached to products. In
most cases, you will need the price displayed along with the product description
and Add to Cart form.</p>
<p>Another use case is the product image field created during the Commerce
Kickstart installation. This is especially the case for groups of products where
each variation contains a unique image (e.g. for a different color of the
product, such as a lipstick). You will want this image rendered into the node
display that groups these products together.</p>
<p>When the customer updates the Add to Cart form for a group of products to
select a different product from the group, the price, image, and other injected
fields will be updated to represent the newly selected product.</p>

<p>By adding fields to your line item types, you can expose customization
options to the customer on the Add to Cart form. If you have multiple types of
customizable products, you can create additional product line item types and use
them on different Add to Cart forms.</p>
