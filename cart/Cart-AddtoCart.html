<h1>Add-to-Cart Buttons for Drupal Commerce</h1>
<h2>What is the Add-to-Cart button?</h2>
<p>Almost everything in Drupal Commerce is put together using a common Drupal
pattern: Content (entity and fields system), Views (listing things), and Rules
(taking actions on events). The Add-to-Cart button is no different. But there
is a bit of <em>mythical Drupal magic</em> that makes this button show up and
we aim to help you peer behind the curtains.</p>
<h2>Add-to-Cart Configuration using Fields</h2>
<p>With Drupal Commerce 1.2, we've replaced the Add-to-Cart magic with
dependable configuration settings. By altering forms in the Field UI, we now
embed options to help you create complex Add to Cart forms. Below are three
documented ways to access, alter, or create Add-to-Cart buttons.</p>
<ol class="inpagenav">
    <li><a href="#product-reference-field">Product Reference Field</a> - An
    Add-to-Cart button that is configured on the Display Node.</li>
    <li><a href="#product-type-field">Product Type Field</a> - An Add-to-Cart
    button that is configured on the Product Entity level.</li>
    <li><a href="#line-item-field">Line Item Field</a> - An Add-to-Cart
    button that is configured on the Line Item level.</li>
</ol>

        <p>When you add a <a href="../products/Prod-Disp-Node.html">product
        reference field to an entity</a>, you have the option of injecting
        fields from the referenced products into the display of the referencing
        entity.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>A great example of a product reference field is the one found in the Product
display node type that Commerce Kickstart creates. The product reference field
enables prices, images, and other fields attached to your products to be
displayed in the node along with an Add-to-Cart button.</p>

<p>By adding fields to your product types, you can create a group of
products representing variations of the same base product (e.g. different
sizes of the same style and design of a shirt). There's a simple checkbox to
start using field data on the Add to Cart form along with an optional widget
choice.</p>

<p>By adding fields to your line item types, you can expose customization
options to the customer on the Add to Cart form. If you have multiple types of
customizable products, you can create additional product line item types and use
them on different Add to Cart forms.</p>
