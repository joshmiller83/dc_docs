<h1>Anonymous Carts and Logged In Users</h1>
<p>There are many topics covered in this Drupal Commerce Anonymous Carts
article. The experience you want to give your customers can greatly depend on
how well you handle the Anonymous to Authenticated conversion process. Much of
this is automated, but there can be a few hang ups.</p>
<h2>Cart Conversion</h2>
<p>What happens when an anonymous customer finds a product and clicks "Add to
Cart?" An order is created for that customer's anonymous session. Like most
customers, they realize that logging in with their account can give them a
certain advantage during the checkout process. Perhaps they don't have to fill
out their customer profile information or perhaps they are a part of a "Free
Shipping" user role. What happens to their cart?</p>
<p>When anonymous users login to the site, if they have a shopping cart, that
order is moved to be a part of the authenticated session. Anonymous cart
conversion is that simple! To barrow from a certain hardware manufacturer, it
should just work. </p>
<h2>Hiding the Cart</h2>
<p>The methods described in this section show you how to hide the shopping carts
in various ways, but we do not describe how to keep users from purchasing
content if they are anonymous. That is a much more involved topic and possibly a
feature request for the <a
href="http://drupal.org/project/commerce_checkout_login">commerce_checkout_login
module</a>.</p>
<h3>Hide Shopping Cart Block from Anonymous</h3>
<p>In most cases, if you want the shopping cart to be hidden from anonymous
users, hiding the block is the easiest way to pull this off. Below are two
screenshots that will help you with this functionality. If you prefer the more
robust method of hiding the shopping cart using the Views interface, skip down
to that section below.</p>

        block and click "Configure block."</p>

<h3>Hide Shopping Cart from Anonymous using Views Permissions</h3>
<p>If you want to hide the /cart page, we have a very simple method that
requires editing a core View. Relax, that's why we use Views instead of our own
half-baked solutions. And think of it this way, if you edit your view and it
doesn't work out, you can always click "Revert" and everything will go back to
the fresh and shiny version that ships with Commerce.</p>

        users.</p>

<p>Be sure to click "Save" on the View and test your shopping cart for what an
anonymous user would experience.</p>
<h3>Hide Shopping Cart if nothing purchased</h3>
<p>Let's say you don't like the default "empty" shopping cart that appears in
the sidebar for Commerce Kickstart. There is a not-so-straightforward way to do this, so hang in there. The Shopping Cart Block that is enabled in the Commerce Kickstart project is actually setup in code. What we need to do is disable that block, create a new Views Block, and enable the Views block instead.</p>

<h2>Carts Expiration</h2>
<p>Old carts will remain indefinitely until they are checked out or manually
removed by administrators. Old cart orders can contain valuable information that
you may not want to erase before extracting the data for use particularly as
marketing research or contact information for follow-up sales contacts.</p>
<p>This can cause some confusion given the following scenario:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Authenticated user creates a cart, but logs out.</li>
    <li>Anonymous user re-creates their cart a few days later, and logs in.</li>
    <li>After checkout, the user is presented with their most recent cart which
    was the one they created in step 1.</li>
    <li>Worst case scenario is that the user thinks their checkout didn't happen
    and they go through it all again.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this case, you may find some nicely handled features in a contributed
module that can expire carts for you:
<a href="http://drupal.org/project/commerce_cart_expiration">commerce_cart_expiration</a>.</p>
