<h1>Modifying the Shopping Cart using Views</h1>
<p>Drupal's strength is that the modules work together. Imagine a world where
you can build the most amazing content lister. It could give you as much or even
more control than raw SQL. Now, imagine a world where an ecommerce platform
completely worked with that amazing content lister. We each have our focus and
leave the "annoying" stuff to the other guy. The end result is everything we can
do is pluggable and has more use cases than we can possibly imagine.</p>
<p><strong>That world exists.</strong> The content lister is called <a
href="http://dev.nodeone.se/en/taming-the-beast-learn-views-with-nodeone">Views</a>
and here we document how you can use Views to do just about anything with your
shopping cart or shopping basket.</p>
<h2>Shopping Cart Block and Page</h2>
<p>You would be tempted to think that the shopping cart block and the cart page
are from the same view with different displays. After all, that is a very common
pattern in Drupal. However for Drupal Commerce 1.x, Views 3.x was very much in
beta and to avoid forgotten bugs, the decision was made to make both the block
and the page separate views that only have a master display. This means, if you
want to edit either the block or the page, know that you must edit both
individually.</p>

<h2>Creating a Shopping Cart from Scratch</h2>
<p>"Sometimes the best way to learn is to rebuild it." I imagine Tony Stark
would have said that at some point. Let's play the engineer and see how the
Commerce Guys were able to build a shopping cart in Views.</p>
