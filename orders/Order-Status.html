<h1>Order States and Statuses</h1>
<p>Each order in Drupal Commerce has a very important identifying piece of information defined by a group called a "state" and a phase called a "status."</p>

<div class="screenshot">

        <img src="../screenshots/Order-Status.png" alt="Order Status Screen" />
    </a>
    <ul class="screenshot_breadcrumbs">
        <li class="first">Administration</li>
        <li>Store</li>
        <li>Orders</li>
        <li class="last">Add/Edit Orders</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<h2>Order Module States</h2>
<p>The Order module defines several order states in its own implementation of this hook, commerce_order_commerce_order_state_info():</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Canceled</strong>: For orders that have been canceled through some user action.</li>
    <li><strong>Pending</strong>: For orders that have been created and are awaiting further action.</li>
    <li><strong>Completed</strong>: For orders that have been completed as far as the customer should be concerned.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cart &amp; Checkout Module States</h2>
<p>Additionally, the cart and checkout modules define the following order states:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Shopping cart</strong>: for orders that have not been completed by the customer yet.</li>
    <li><strong>Checkout</strong>: for orders that have begun but not yet completed the checkout process.</li>
</ul>
