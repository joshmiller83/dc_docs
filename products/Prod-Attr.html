<h1>Product Attributes &amp; Variations</h1>
<p>Product attributes are the descriptors we use to define kinds of products.
For example, we could describe a pencil by the color or the hardness of lead.
These attributes are the reason ecommerce stores must deal with product
variations. Every software must abstract this information in some way to be
useful. Here's how Drupal Commerce abstracts it:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Product Types.</strong> A product type is a custom product entity that can have fields attached to it, including pictures and other kinds of information. You can create a Product Type that has certain features or attributes.</li>
    <li><strong>Product Fields.</strong> Each list field on a product type that has fixed values can be used as a drop down on the product display node. </li>
    <li><strong>Product Displays.</strong> If needed at all, these are groupings of products. You can reference any type and number of products on a product display. In order to make use of product displays, we recommend only showing one type of product per product display. The product display is where you typically see the product with drop downs to "configure" or "order" the right kind of product.</li>
</ol>
<p>Using our pencil analogy, perhaps you have a manufacturer who ships
mechanical pencils in three different lead weights. You would create a pencil
product type, with lead weight fields, and create a product display for three
distinct products which are the same pencil, just each with a unique lead weight
(perhaps a unique picture, etc).</p>
<p>Fields attached to products can be exposed on Add to Cart forms as attribute
fields. These are common fields among a group of products whose allowed values
may be used to select a particular product from the group to add to the
cart.</p>
<P>The settings for attribute fields are built into the field edit form. These
are typically List fields and Taxonomy term reference fields, because they have
a discreet number of options. Attribute fields can use select list or radio
button widgets on the Add to Cart form.</P>
<H2>Example Field Injection</H2>
<p>The products that are added with Commerce Kickstart 1.x do not have field injection turned on. But using the following steps you can get an idea of how to make this happen on your system.</p>

        <p>Navigate to your Store page and click on "Products" and then "Product
        Types" and then "Manage Fields." This is the standard way to find,
        create, and edit different types of product. You can add as many types
        of products as you want, but make sure you understand the difference
        between product types and product displays.</p>

        <p>When you navigate to the manage field screen, if you are a Drupal
        native, you'll notice that the field screen is just like a manage field
        screen for content types. We'll need a List (text) using a select list.
        This could also be a taxonomy term reference, or any kind of simple list
        field.</p>
